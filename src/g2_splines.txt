The functions "g2_c_spline" and "g2_c_b_spline" are derived from
"mth_spline" and "mth_b_spline" in the file "/gli/src/math.c".

Both functions are, however, heavily modified.

The following functions take five arguments:

void g2_spline		(int id, int n, double *x, double *y, int o);
void g2_b_spline	(int id, int n, double *x, double *y, int o);
void g2_filled_spline	(int id, int n, double *x, double *y, int o);
void g2_filled_b_spline	(int id, int n, double *x, double *y, int o);

Given an array of n x-coordinates and an array of n y-coordinates a
spline curve is plotted on device id with o interpolated points per
data point. So the larger o, the more fluent the curve.

The sample program "g2_splines_demo.c" shows how to use these functions.
