Installation
============

LINUX
-----

Either install RPM packet with binaries, or compile as described in the
UNIX section 

UNIX 
----

1. Extract package with gzip -dc g2-xxxx.tar.gz | tar xvf - 

2. Run './configure'

3. Optionally run 'make depend'

4. Run 'make' 

5. Run 'make install' or copy libg2.a and g2.h, g2_X11.h, g2_GIF.h, and
   g2_PS.h to the default locations for library and include files. 

6. Optional: run 'make demo' to compile demo applications 


WINDOWS NT
----------

1. Extract package: unzip 'g2-xxxx.zip' 

2. MS Visual C++ users can build both library and demos with the supplied
   project file: g2.xxx 
   users of gcc or other commandline based compilers with make support
   continue as in Unix example 


VMS
---

1. set default to root of distribution directory

2. type mms to build g2.olb library

3. to compile demo files, set defualt to [.demo] and type mms

4. to install: copy g2.olb and g2.h, g2_X11.h and g2_PS.h to install
   directories


GIF-SUPPORT
-----------

g2 needs to be linked to the free available gd library written by
Thomas Boutell in order to create GIF files.  g2 is tested with
version 1.3 of gd. gd is available at http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and
at numerous mirror sites.  Use a ftp search
(e.g. http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/) and search for "gd1.3.tar.gz" to find
your nearest mirror site.


PERL SUPPORT
------------
1. build g2 library
2. cd to g2_perl and run
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test


SHARED LIBRARIES
----------------
Support for shared libraries is tested on Linux and OSF
(DigitalUnix). To build shared libraries type 'make shared'. If you
want to run demo applications without installed shared libraries, you
should add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH the path to the g2 shared library
(e.g. 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/some/path/to/g2')
